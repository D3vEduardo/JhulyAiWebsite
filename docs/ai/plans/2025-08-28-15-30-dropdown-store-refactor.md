# Dropdown Store Refactoring Plan

## Current State Analysis

The current dropdown store implementation in `src/store/dropdown.ts` has several areas that could be improved for readability and maintainability:

1. Complex function signatures with inline parameter definitions
2. Repetitive code patterns in several methods
3. Complex partialize function in the persist middleware
4. Some methods have similar functionality but are implemented separately

## Identified Issues

1. **Function Signatures**: The function signatures are verbose and could be simplified by extracting parameter types.
2. **Code Duplication**: `selectValue` and `updateSelectedValue` have similar functionality.
3. **Complex Partialize Logic**: The `partialize` function in the persist middleware is hard to read.
4. **Naming Consistency**: Some parameter names could be more consistent.

## Proposed Solutions

1. Extract complex parameter types into separate interfaces
2. Consolidate similar functions where possible
3. Simplify the partialize function logic
4. Improve naming consistency
5. Add better code organization and comments

## Implementation Steps

1. Create interfaces for function parameters to simplify signatures
2. Refactor the `selectValue` and `updateSelectedValue` functions
3. Simplify the `partialize` function in the persist middleware
4. Improve code organization and add comments where necessary
5. Ensure all functionality remains the same

## Risk Assessment

- Low risk as we're only refactoring for readability
- All existing functionality should remain intact
- No breaking changes expected

## Success Criteria

- Improved code readability
- Reduced code duplication
- Maintained all existing functionality
- No performance impact
