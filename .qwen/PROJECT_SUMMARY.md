# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix critical bugs in the Jhuly AI chatbot platform related to prompt suggestions causing duplicated balloons, reasoning display problems, and message balloon compression issues in the chat interface.

## Key Knowledge
- The application is a Next.js 15 application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, and Better Auth
- Two major bugs identified: 1) Prompt suggestions causing duplicated balloons and reasoning issues, 2) Chat message balloons getting compressed to zero height
- The problems were traced to useEffect dependency issues in PromptForm.tsx and CSS/layout issues in ChatMessages.tsx and ChatBalloon.tsx
- The project uses Framer Motion for animations and has complex state management via ChatContext
- Environment requires Node.js >= 22.0.0 and pnpm >= 10.8.0

## Recent Actions
- **Fixed prompt suggestion duplication issue**: Updated useEffect in PromptForm.tsx with proper cleanup and dependency array to prevent multiple event listeners
- **Fixed balloon compression issue**: 
  - Removed `overflow-y-hidden` class from message containers in ChatMessages.tsx
  - Added `min-h-[60px]` class to ChatBalloon base styling to prevent collapse
  - Changed layout animation from dynamic to `layout={false}` for better performance
- **Documentation created**: Detailed investigations saved in docs/ai/ directory for both issues
- All changes maintain the existing architecture while addressing the specific bugs

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Investigate and fix prompt suggestion duplication bug
2. [DONE] Investigate and fix message balloon compression issues
3. [DONE] Document findings in docs/ai/ directory
4. [DONE] Implement fixes for both issues
