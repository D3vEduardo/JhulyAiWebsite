# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Migrate and refactor the Jhuly AI Website project to implement modern best practices including API REST endpoints with pagination, proper environment variable separation, and improved logging while maintaining the existing functionality and user experience.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Hono.js for API routes, TanStack Query for data fetching, Better Auth for authentication
- **Environment Variables**: Split into `@client.env.ts` (client-side safe variables) and `@server.env.ts` (server-side sensitive variables)
- **Pagination**: Implemented infinite scrolling with Intersection Observer and `useInfiniteQuery` for chat messages and user chats
- **API Architecture**: Hono.js routes with proper middleware (auth, admin) and Zod validation
- **Frontend Components**: Custom UI components with Tailwind CSS and proper state management using Zustand
- **Build Commands**: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm prisma:push`
- **Logging**: All console logs migrated to `console.debug` with file and function identifiers

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Migrated server actions to API REST endpoints for chat messages and user data
